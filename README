Should be a standard;

cmake .. 
make 

from build directory. CmakeLists were quickly written and not tested anywhere!


To run example N (there are 5 examples)
I think they currently are hardcoded to work in build/examples only.

./examples --xml ../../xml/uboone.xml --test N


sbn.xml and uboone.xml are included in xml folder, but easily modified

TODO: 
make it so the absolute path for data/ is taken in by cmake.
